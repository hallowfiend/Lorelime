# Overview
The Six Galaxies is the galaxy cluster inhabited by humanity in the Borderlands series. It is not a figurative name - it has been confirmed that it is six separate galaxies.
Other galaxies do exist, but have not been reached, as it would require FTL technology of power and magnitude that has not yet been invented. [[Six Galaxies#^1|1]]

# Regions
- Celestica Eridiana, or the Borderlands: The forefront of galactic exploration, and where the story of the series takes place.
- Five other unnamed galaxies.

timeline
    Unknown amount of years ago : The Eridians emerge in this universe, then die out.
    302 to 107 years ago : The Colonial Era.
    : After finally mastering superluminal flight, the human race begins to expand throughout the local cluster of six galaxies.
    : Dozens of "habitable zone" planets are colonized in multiple star systems over a period of centuries.
    : A central galactic goverment is established.
    107 y.a. : Major private megacorporations rally against "the regulatory state" and launch a widespread revolt against the central galactic government.
    71 y.a. : After decades of bloody, genocidal fighting, the tide finally turns against the central goverment at a decisive engagement during which an entire galactic expeditionary force is eviscerated by a molecular disruptor accident. Within weeks, the corporate alliance declares a glorious victory and starts divvying up the sectors.
    : Megacorporations are now the governing forces across the inhabited regions. Corporate executives become "regional governors". Some rule more like feudal lords.
    69 y.a. : After two years of intense negotiations, the twenty-six major conglomerates sign the historic Thirty-Year Accord, a remarkable document that lays out a comprehensive thirty-year plan for peaceful trade, mutual defense, and cultural exchange between corporate regions. All six galaxies hail a new era of cooperative engagement.
    : The Thirty-Year Accord lasts almost four months.
    68 y.a. : Market competition between the ruling corporations escalates quickly to miliary conflict, resulting in a series of brutal clashes known as the Corporate Wars. Large companies crush and devour smaller companies in a survival-of-the-fittest frenzy of attrition.
    : The onslaught of corporate mercenary armies drives refugees from developed worlds outward to sparsely populated frontier planets.
    59 y.a. : Nine more years of ruthless warfare finally ends when a small handful of the biggest megacorporations form a new alliance (or an illegal oligopoly, depending on your point of view) that stamps out all other corporations. Winners include Atlas, Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Tediore, Torgue and Vladof.
    : One manufacturer survives, and even thrives without military engagement. The family-run Jakobs corporation maintains its neutrality and market share by sticking closely to its ancestral brand and bunkering into a lush moon of the gas giant Eden in the Beta Ceti III system.
    : S&S Munitions also survives, largely through a labirynthine matrix of proprietary technology licensing agreements and alliances. However, with no formal military of their own, their position is precariously predicated on a volatile market they have little influence in.
